# Theme Protagonist

Premium Wordpress Theme development.

## Dev uses SASS so remember:

**Before starting open Terminal and navigate to the themes folder then type:**

```
sass --watch style:output
```

or to just watch the one file instead of the whole folder:

~~~~
sass --watch style.scss:output.css
~~~~

*(this automatically watches and converts the SCSS file to the output CSS file every time it is saved)*
